# Repository for public documents related to the U19 Orofacial Collaboration

**List of files**

- Stereotaxic surgery log sheet.xlsx: example of injection surgery logs used in the lab. Similar spreadsheets are used for electrode/probe implantation procedures. Information from those records should be uploaded to the database
- Stereotaxic surgery log sheet_Filled.jpg: example of filled logs after surgery
- wanglab.py: Python code used to generate lab-wide DataJoint schema 
- TGvIRt.py: Python code used to generate DataJoint schema for vIRt ephys experiments  
- vIRt20_Probe33.xlsx: example of notes kept for chronic recordings. NB: there are two tabs (tracksheet to record depth of each tetrode, and Notes)
- Experiment Note Sheet - vIRt22.xlsx: example of notes kept for semi-chronic recordings. This is basically an extension of a surgery log.
- erd-lab.png and erd-TGvIRt.png: Entity relationship diagrams (ERD) for initial pipeline (lab + ephys experiments)
